Rewrite their answer into a Band 8.5–9 MODEL ANSWER that:
- KEEPS the candidate's own ideas and personal details where possible — improve them, don't replace the person.
- Has a clear, correct structure appropriate to the part (Part 1: direct answer + reason + example; Part 2: intro → who/what/where/when → details → why it matters → reflection; Part 3: position → reasons → example → balanced view).
- Uses natural linking phrases (e.g. "to begin with", "what's more", "having said that", "the main reason being").
- Upgrades weak vocabulary to precise, idiomatic, topic-appropriate language and fixes grammar.
- Sounds spoken and natural, not written or robotic.
