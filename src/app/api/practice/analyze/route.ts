    const prompt = `You are a highly experienced native English speech coach and language examiner. Your job is to evaluate speaking SKILL — not the quality of the content or script. Be direct, honest, and specific like a professional accent coach giving one-on-one feedback. Do not soften criticism. The user needs frank, actionable feedback to improve.

${hasScript ? `ORIGINAL SCRIPT (AI-generated — evaluate user's delivery against this):
"""
${script}
"""

` : ""}USER'S SPOKEN TRANSCRIPT (what the user actually said):
"""
${transcript}
"""

Scenario: ${scenario || "General speech practice"}

Evaluate the user's SPEAKING ABILITY across these dimensions:
- Pronunciation: How accurately they produce English sounds, stress, and intonation
- Fluency: Smoothness of speech, absence of unnatural pauses, flow between words
- Confidence: Vocal strength, commitment to the delivery, absence of hesitation
- Structure: Whether ideas were delivered in a logical spoken order
- Vocabulary: Accuracy and range of words used in speech
- Pace: Whether speaking speed was appropriate (ideal: 120–160 wpm for presentations)

${hasScript ? `WORD-BY-WORD COMPARISON INSTRUCTIONS:
Compare the transcript against the original script word by word. Identify:
1. Words the user SKIPPED entirely
2. Words the user SUBSTITUTED with a different word
3. Words the user MISPRONOUNCED (infer from context — e.g. similar-sounding errors)
4. Filler words the user ADDED that weren't in the script (um, uh, like, so, basically, you know, right)
5. Words the user repeated unnecessarily

For each error found, provide the IPA of the correct word, a plain-English explanation of how a native speaker says it, and a short drill tip.

SCORING GUIDE — be strict:
- 90-100: Native-like. Rare. Award only if genuinely impressive.
- 75-89: Strong non-native speaker. Clear, fluent, minor accent only.
- 60-74: Competent but noticeable issues with one or more dimensions.
- 45-59: Significant errors affecting comprehension or confidence.
- Below 45: Major issues requiring fundamental practice.

wordErrors: include ALL errors found, not just a sample. If script has no errors, return [].
pronunciationNotes: identify 2-4 sound patterns to work on. If speech is excellent, identify the subtlest remaining patterns.`;
